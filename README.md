<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Our Problem?
I had to wonder, with all the continuing ecological crisis facing the planet even if every single one of us adopted
these conservation habits was this really gonna be enough to save the world?

It just seemed that there was something more to the story. I thought I was doing everything I could to help the planet.
But then with one's friend's post everything changed. The post sent me to a report online published by the United Nations stating that cows produce more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector. This means that raising cattle produces more greenhouse gases than all cars, trucks, trains, boats, planes combined. Thirteen percent compared to 18 percent for livestock. This is because cows produce a substantial amount of methane from their digestive process. Methane gas from livestock
is 25to 100 times more destructive than carbon dioxide from vehicles. But it turns out there's more to climate change than just fossil fuels.

I did more research. The U.N. along with other agencies reported not only did livestock play a major role in global warming it is also the leading cause
of resource consumption and environmental degradation destroying the planet today.
As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day; many lack food. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.

Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There are 821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously underweight.

## What is Our Solution?
Actually, This is a bazaar app. But this perspective is really wrong about it. We aim to reduce food waste with the Icarus app.  
Basic foodstuffs that cannot be sold due to economic reasons and whose expiration date has passed continue to be thrown away. The solution is simple: By selling products whose expiration date is approaching at high, discounts both waste will be reduced and the consumer will smile.

We are Icarus. We will show that solving big problems like climate change, poverty and hunger is possible. Moreover, we will show that helping to solve these problems can be fun, and way easier than people think. We will show that action can be taken by your group of friends, your department of colleagues, or just by you together with strangers. You can make a real impact, make a real change, and have fun doing it.

People want to act, but see that governments are moving too slow and that individual action is too small. By offering a hub for people to unite, we amplify individual impact. At the same time this hub keeps the barrier to act low and the impact immediate. Alone we are a drop in the ocean, together we make waves.

LOCAL ACTION, GLOBAL IMPACT

<!-- ABOUT ICARUS -->
## The Story of Icarus Name

The App Name Idea Coming From -> [Iron Maiden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4w2BZXL6Ss)
When I was listening to Iron Maiden's song, I realize this is the song of a mythological characther.

In Greek mythology, Icarus  was the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Icarus and Daedalus attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that Daedalus constructed from feathers and wax. Daedalus warns Icarus first of complacency and then of hubris, instructing him to fly neither too low nor too high, lest the sea's dampness clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignores Daedalus‚Äôs instructions not to fly too close to the sun, causing the wax in his wings to melt. He tumbles out of the sky, falls into the sea, and drowns. The myth gave rise to the idiom "don't fly too close to the sun".

## Icaria (Team Name)

Icaria, also spelled Ikaria, is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, 10 nautical miles (19 km) southwest of Samos. According to tradition, it derives its name from Icarus, the son of Daedalus in Greek mythology, who was believed to have fallen into the sea nearby.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run any Android application built with Flutter you need to configure the enviroments in your machine, you can do this following the the tutorial provided by Google in [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio (to download Android SDK)
- Xcode (for iOS develop only)
- Any IDE with Flutter SDK installed (ie. IntelliJ, Android Studio, VSCode etc)
- A little knowledge of Dart and Flutter

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/YunusEmreAlps/Icarus.git
```

### Setup

To run the app you need to have an online emulator or a plugged device and run the following command in the root of the application.

#### Android
```
flutter run
``` 
### iOS (_MAC Only_)

```
flutter run
``` 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/YunusEmreAlps/Icarus/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## ü§î Contributing (Feel free to contribute!)

Awesome! Contributions of all kinds are greatly appreciated. To help smoothen the process we have a few non-exhaustive guidelines to follow which should get you going in no time.

Every night & every deploy, the spread sheet will be parsed by GitHub actions, then generate this beauty. Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

### Using GitHub Issues

- Feel free to use GitHub issues for questions, bug reports, and feature requests
- Use the search feature to check for an existing issue
- Include as much information as possible and provide any relevant resources (Eg. screenshots)
- For bug reports ensure you have a reproducible test case
  - A pull request with a breaking test would be super preferable here but isn't required

### Submitting a Pull Request

- Squash commits
- Lint your code with eslint (config provided)
- Include relevant test updates/additions
